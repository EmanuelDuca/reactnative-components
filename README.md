# Expo Router and Tailwind CSS

Use [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview/) styling.

The components are done using ReactNative with Tailwindcss.
Its posible to test the components on mobile using Expo.
(`!Hint: Install Expo on your local Iphone, then scan the QR code from the terminal`)

Notice that I am using Node verison: 20.6.0
Should work with newer version of Node
